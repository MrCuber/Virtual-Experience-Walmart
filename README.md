# Virtual Experience: Walmart Advanced Software Engineer
## Overview
The Virtual Experience for Walmart's Advanced Software Engineer position is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and challenges that we may encounter in your role at Walmart. Through these tasks, we will have the opportunity to showcase our technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
## Tasks
1. **Task 1: Designing a Scalable System**\
In this task, we will be given a scenario where we need to design a scalable system for handling high volumes of customer orders. we'll be expected to analyze the requirements, identify potential bottlenecks, and propose an efficient architecture that can handle the load effectively. In this Task I designed a Modified Heap where it generates 2<sup>x</sup> childs for every parent node.
The heap must satisfy the heap property.
<ul>
  <li>Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.</li>
  <li>The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor.</li>
  <li>The heap must implement an insert method.</li>
  <li>The heap must implement a pop max method.</li>
  <li>The heap must be implemented in Java.</li>
  <li>The heap must be performant.</li>
  <li>You must use a more descriptive variable name than x in your implementation.</li>
</ul>
